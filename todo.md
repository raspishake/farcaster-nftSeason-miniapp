next Up:

- notifications: update readme for the notifications and editor work we did together in this chat (please specify what neynar is used for so dev's don't think this is somehow a neynar app)
- notifications: output a file that includes the documentation you wish you had at the start of this process which would have made all of this so much less painful and eliminated our need to "feel around in the dark". Comment on utility/ quality of documentation here: https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/guides/notifications
- send out cast about it
